			<h1>Welcome to the <strong>Historic Olivet Baptist Church</strong></h1>
			<h2>Love, Service, Fellowship</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="about">
				<h3>If these walls could talk</h3>
				<p>The Olivet Baptist Church building was once a musical and cultural hub in the heart of the Hill District in Pittsburgh. Today, after years of neglect and transitions of ownership, the beautiful old structure has lost its grandeur.</p>
				<p>The church today is run solely by Reverend Tyrone Munson and the volunteerism of its humble congregation. With its pillars of fellowship, servanthood, and love, the church upholds giving back to the community, having open arms and open doors.</p>

			<h3>Olivet's dazzling past</h3>
			<p>The Olivet Baptist Church was originally founded in 1953 with 200-ish people; splinter group from the Calvary Baptist Church on Wylie Ave. Built in 1910, originally the Elmore theatre, the building then housed the original Savoy Ballroom; before the Savoy was moved and the building turned into a church.</p>

			<h3>The Elmore Theatre</h3>
			<p>The Olivet Church is housed in what used to be the Elmore Theatre, built in the year of 1923 and opened on the eighth of that September. It was the swankiest theater on the Hill, showing first-run movies accompanied by a $10,000 pipe organ. It was host to daring vaudeville acts, bombastic blues, and to jazz singers like Ma Rainey, ‘Jelly-Roll’ Morton, and Bessie Smith. Musicians and performers traveling from New York to Chicago would stop in Pittsburgh, always in the Hill, often at the Elmore.</p>
			<p>After a decade of bringing music and cinema to the Hill, the theater’s reputation started to slip. By 1930, Engelberg couldn’t attract enough live performers to the theatre, and it became strictly a movie-theatre again. Engelberg’s reputation slipped too, and by 1933, the swankiest theater in the Hill had run ragged.</p>
			<p>That year, a Hill District businessman started eyeing the Elmore, seeing an opportunity in the Elmore building, even in its diminished state and would re-name it Pittsburgh’s “Savoy Ballroom”.</p>

			<h3>The Original Savoy Ballroom</h3>
			<p>The newly-christened Savoy opened to rave reviews in the papers—</p>
			<blockquote>[Patrons] marveled at the modern crystal ball, with four spotlights, flashing their vari-colored lights on the mirrored surface and producing an effect which made a waltz a “thing of beauty and a Joy forever.” …. It’s a place in a class by itself.</blockquote>
			<p>Ella Fitzgerald stopped in at the Pittsburgh Savoy with Chick Webb, together on their way from Chicago to the (admittedly, more famous) Savoy in New York City.</p>
			<p>But the Savoy moved to a new building, and a decade after the opening of the original Savoy, and two decades after the original Elmore Theatre—the building’s run as a pleasure palace was over.</p>
			<p>By the 50’s the Elmore/Savoy building, and its history, had mostly been forgotten. In 1953 its ownership was transferred once again, and the building started another chapter in its life—serving as a hall of worship. </p>
			<p>The new church was an offshoot of an older neighborhood church in the Hill. In the independent spirit of baptist organizations, 200 or so congregants up and left the Calvary Baptist Church on Wylie Ave. and founded the Olivet Baptist Church.</p>

			<h3>Take an O.F.F. Day at Olivet!</h3>
			<p>Today, the building’s old bones have been covered by drop ceilings, linoleum and wood paneling. But there are still signs of its history, if you look hard enough. A gap in the drop ceiling reveals the grand height of the ballroom; the slightly raked floor under the church pews hints at the past.</p>
			<p>We are a group of students from Carnegie Mellon University who want to support this church and its pillars of fellowship, servanthood, and love. We were inspired by the building’s musical history to plan a music festival as a fundraiser for the Church.</p>
			<p>The Olivet Fun Fest (O.F.F. DAY!) will be a one-day musical event in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, featuring ensembles from the Afro-American Music Institute, student bands, and local groups. All proceeds from tickets and refreshments will go to benefit Olivet Baptist, helping the church reconnect with its community and share its rich history with Pittsburgh.</p>
			<span>DONATE</span>
			<p>Help us bring the Hill’s first annual O.F.F. DAY to life! Join us April 23rd for local music groups, good food, and a taste of The Hill both past and present.</p>
